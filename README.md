GitHub Submission

1. Janela Contreras janelac12@gmail.com

2. My GitHub account is new and so far the only respository I have is this one (janelac.github.io). 

3. I created a README.md file repository that is public. 

4. When cloning the repository I created I first downloaded GitHub onto my desktop and signed into my account. I then clicked the option that said "Clone a Respository from the Internet" which was followed by a pop up window showing a list of my respoitories. I chose the repository I had created "janelac.github.io" and cloned to subfolder under my CTI-110 class folder and clicked "Clone repository" and it was cloned.
